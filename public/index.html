            <h2><b>Volunteering at ONE Tech Hub (2023)</b></h2>
            <p>In my role, I had the responsibility of introducing pupils to various branches of computer science courses and actively engaging with them during coding lessons. I facilitated their learning process by providing comprehensive information on different domains within computer science, including algorithms, data structures, software development, artificial intelligence, databases, and more.</p>

                <p>Moreover, I interacted with the pupils, offering guidance and support as they embarked on their coding journey. This involved assisting them in grasping programming concepts, addressing their inquiries, providing constructive feedback on their code, and guiding them through coding exercises and projects.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, my primary focus was to foster a dynamic and interactive learning environment that enabled students to explore the diverse realms of computing science and develop their coding skills.

            <p>As a My World of Work Ambassador, my role involved taking the initiative to guide pupils and their parents through the various tools and features offered on the My World of Work website. The objective was to familiarise them with the website so that, in the event their child faced uncertainties about their future educational path after Secondary School, they would already have a working knowledge of the My World of Work platform to assist them.</p>

            <p>In this capacity, I proactively provided guidance, ensuring individuals were well-versed in utilising the website's resources. By offering comprehensive assistance, I aimed to empower students and parents to navigate the platform effectively when considering potential courses for further education.</p>In this capacity, I proactively provided guidance, ensuring individuals were well-versed in utilising the website's resources.

            <h2><b>Boolean (2024)</b></h2>
            <p>I participated in a one-week virtual session of the Boolean program, where I acquired proficiency in developing three distinct games, including Crossy Roads, a bomb game, and a stacker game. This immersive experience provided me with comprehensive insights into the practical application of JavaScript and CSS within the realm of game development.</p>

            <h2><b>RGU Hackathon (2024)</b></h2>
            <p>Over the course of 24 hours, my team undertook the challenge presented by the company Core 29 to implement a project aimed at making a difference in climate change. The approach my team took to address this challenge involved creating an app that stores a leaderboard, with the individual at the top having caused the least carbon emissions. This was accomplished by developing an API that quantifies the carbon emissions generated by the objects we use in our daily lives and implementing the app using Flutter software.</p>
