        <p class="text gradient1">Throughout my life, one of my primary hobbies has been Bharatanatyam, also known as Indian classical dance. Engaging in this art form has instilled in me the virtues of self-discipline, as I have dedicated countless hours to practise. Through perseverance, I have learned to overcome stressful situations and pay meticulous attention to the intricate hand movements that define the sophistication of each performance. Beyond dance, I find solace in listening to music, particularly pop music, to alleviate stress.</p>
        <p class="text gradient2">According to feedback from my peers, teachers, and self-assessment, I possess several notable strengths. Diligence is a defining trait of mine, enabling me to maintain an unwavering focus on assigned tasks. Moreover, I consistently exhibit a friendly demeanour towards those around me, fostering positive interpersonal relationships.</p>
        <p class="text gradient3">Looking ahead my aspirations revolve around establishing myself as a software engineer at a distinguished company. To achieve this goal, I have chosen to pursue a degree in Computing Science at the esteemed University of Aberdeen. By embarking on this educational journey, I aim to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the field and develop the necessary skills to excel in a competitive professional environment.</p>
