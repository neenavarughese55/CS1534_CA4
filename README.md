Design Report: Web Dev Chat Application Assignment
Introduction
For this assignment, the primary aim was to create a website that serves as both a personal and professional portfolio, featuring a chat application. The design focused on achieving simplicity and responsiveness across various devices while ensuring that the website reflected personal preferences and interests. Throughout the development process, challenges were encountered, but these were addressed through problem-solving and experimentation.

Design Considerations
Colour Scheme
The selection of a colour scheme was a crucial aspect of the design process. By choosing carefully from a palette of shades such as #691269, #D8BFD8, #928bd4, white, and #bab3f9, I aimed to evoke a sense of individuality and personality while maintaining visual harmony and coherence. Purple, a favourite colour, was the predominant hue, chosen to imbue the website with a personal touch.

Navigation Bar
Bootstrap's CSS framework played a pivotal role in crafting a responsive navigation bar that not only looked good but also functioned well across different screen sizes. Leveraging Bootstrap's predefined classes such as .navbar and .navbar-nav, we streamlined the development process and ensured consistency in design. Additionally, customisations such as the inclusion of a star PNG image and font adjustments added a unique touch to the navigation menu, enhancing its visual appeal and reinforcing the website's personalisation.

Page Design
Home and About Pages
Attention to detail was paramount in designing the Home and About pages, which serve as the primary landing and informational sections of the website, respectively. The use of layered effects with square backgrounds for headings created a visually engaging aesthetic, while the integration of border styles throughout the pages contributed to a cohesive design language. Despite encountering challenges, such as the positioning of headings, these were overcome through perseverance and iterative design refinements, resulting in a polished and professional presentation.

Fun Page
The Fun page provided an opportunity to showcase personality through design elements. Here, we aimed to create an immersive and visually captivating experience by selecting a background image featuring a purple sky. This choice not only complemented the established colour scheme but also added depth and visual interest to the page. Challenges with background image implementation were addressed through the creation of a custom background image class added to the image tag in the fun.html file so that the image would fill the whole page, highlighting the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills in the design process.

Chat Page
Consistency in design was maintained on the Chat page. The presence of a white side navigation bar posed difficulties with overlapping elements, necessitating adjustments to ensure optimal display across different screen sizes. Despite these challenges, the final design successfully integrated the chat functionality within the cohesive visual framework of the website, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the design process for the web dev chat application assignment was characterised by attention to detail, problem-solving, and a commitment to achieving the project objectives. The resulting website stands as a testament to the successful fusion of personal preferences, technical proficiency, and creative expression, serving as an effective portfolio platform with integrated chat functionality.

Report: Assignment 4 - Web Development
Development Approach
For this assignment, I took an iterative approach to development. I started by planning out the structure and features of the website for the Home, About, and Chat Application pages. 
I then proceeded to style the pages with Bootstrap and CSS. I took the time to customise the design so that it was both aesthetically pleasing and responsive because I wanted the website to function and appear well on all devices.
At last, I further implemented the chat programme with additional functionality. Due to the need for real-time communication between the client and server, this was the most challenging section as I facing difficulty displaying the message of the user joining and leaving in the chat. 
Challenges
Getting the chat programme to function properly was the largest obstacle I had to overcome. Since I was unfamiliar with WebSocket, I had to learn a lot and experiment a lot to get it right. Making sure the website looked good across a range of web browsers and screen sizes was another challenge for me.
Technical Details of Chat's Client-Server Communication
WebSocket is the platform that the chat application employs to enable real-time user communication. To create a WebSocket connection, the user sends a handshake request to the server upon connecting. The server then accepts the request. The server then handles user-to-user messages, disseminating them to all chat participants.
All users receive WebSocket messages with typing indications and notifications when other users join or leave the conversation. Everyone participating benefits from a smooth and engaging chat experience as a result.
